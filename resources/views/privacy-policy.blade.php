                Policy and the Terms and Conditions, you expressly consent for ForeverWeLove.com to
                use and disclosure your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy
                Policy. The ForeverWeLove.com Privacy Policy applies to all ForeverWeLove.com

                <p class="heading-space">1. Minors</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                The ForeverWeLove.com website is restricted to adults over the age of 18. Minors are
                not eligible to utilize ForeverWeLove.com Services, including the Websites. Therefore,
                if you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any personal information through
                our website. The ForeverWeLove.com website is not designed or created to solicit
                interest or online activity to anyone who does not meet the age requirements.
                Furthermore, the website and marketing mechanisms are not intended to attract anyone
                under 18. Additionally, ForeverWeLove.com does not collect or retain personally
                identifiable information from users who we know do not meet the established age
                requirements. If ForeverWeLove.com personnel discover or are informed that we have

                <p class="heading-space">2. Information We Collect</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Our objective in collecting personal information is to offer ForeverWeLove.com users a
                well-organized, personalized, and smooth experience. ForeverWeLove.com users’
                profile information may be featured in online marketing materials, editorials and
                newsletters that may be sent to other ForeverWeLove.com Users. However, your full
                name (when not included as a profile name), postal address, telephone number and
                email address are deemed confidential and will not be shared, unless you elected to
                post the information in your profile. ForeverWeLove.com reserves the right to deny
                approval for such profiles. Your profile includes a description, photos, likes and dislikes,
                individual essays, and other information beneficial for determining matches and is

                available for viewing by other ForeverWeLove.com users. Users are responsible for
                ensuring their viewable profile does not include any identifying information, except the
                username selected at the time of registration.<br/>
                We use data collection devices such as &quot;cookies&quot; on certain pages of our Websites.
                &quot;Cookies&quot; are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing
                customized services. We also offer certain features that are only available through the
                use of a &quot;cookie.&quot; Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to
                your interests. We use this information to determine our users&#39; demographics, interests,
                and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information
                may include the URL of the website that you visited prior to our Website (whether this is
                on our site or not), the URL of the website you next go to (whether this URL is on our
                site or not), what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address. Most
                cookies are &quot;session cookies&quot;, meaning that they are automatically deleted from your
                hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your
                browser permits. Anonymized data may be shared with third parties.
                If you choose to access our Websites through a mobile device, on a mobile version of
                the Website, or in an application based version of the Website, we may collect
                additional information about You. This may include, but is not limited to, location data.
                </p>
                <p class="heading-space">3. Information Disclosure</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Due to regulatory requirements, we cannot ensure that all of your private
                communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in
                manners not discussed in this Privacy Policy. For instance, ForeverWeLove.com may
                be required to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or
                third parties. Under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or
                access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse
                information collected from our Website(s). Accordingly, although we use industry
                standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not guarantee, and you should not
                anticipate, your personally identifiable information or private communications will always
                remain concealed.<br/>
                Procedurally, ForeverWeLove.com does not sell or rent any personally identifiable
                information about users to any third party. However, the following describes some of the
                ways that your personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed.<br/>
                &nbsp;A. Financial Information. Under some circumstances we may require certain additional
                information, including but not limited to your credit card billing information. We use this
                financial information, including your name, address, and other information to bill you for
                use of ForeverWeLove.com products and/or services. By making a purchase through
                our website or other platform, or engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that
                uses financial information on the Website(s) or platforms, you consent to disclosure of
                your financial information to ForeverWeLove.com service providers and to such third
                parties as we deem necessary to support and process your activities and transactions,
                to include your credit card issuer for their purposes. Therefore, you agree that
                ForeverWeLove.com may use and disclose all information submitted to such third
                parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other
                information that you submit to us.<br/>
                &nbsp;B. Legal Requests. ForeverWeLove.com cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as
                well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and
                other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law
                enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe
                necessary or appropriate, in connection with any investigation of fraud, intellectual
                property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal
                liability.
                <p class="heading-space">4. Use of other User’s Information</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Our services also include access to instant messaging and chat rooms. As a user you
                have access to users&#39; identification numbers and/or user names, and you might gain
                access to other contact information of other users through the regular use of the
                services. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that, with respect to other users&#39;
                personally identifiable information that you obtain through the Services,
                ForeverWeLove.com hereby grants to you a license to use such information only for: (a)
                ForeverWeLove.com related communications that are not unsolicited commercial
                messages, and (b) any other purpose to which such user expressly agrees after
                complete disclosure of the purpose. In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to
                remove themselves from your database. In addition, under no circumstances, except as
                defined in this Privacy Policy, may you disclose personally identifiable information about
                another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user
                after adequate disclosure. ForeverWeLove.com and our users do not tolerate spam.
                Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add a
                ForeverWeLove.com user to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express
                consent after adequate disclosure. To report spam from other ForeverWeLove.com
                users, please Contact Us.
                </p>
                <p class="heading-space">5. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Profile</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted during
                registration. For instructions on how to do so, visit the Help section of the Websites. If
                you change your password and email address we will retain a record of your old
                password and email address. You can also change your registration information such
                as: name, address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, profile, likes and
                dislikes, desired date profile, essays and saved search criteria.<br/>
                &nbsp;A. Upon your notification, we will remove your membership from our active databases
                as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with our policy and applicable law. To
                learn how to hide or remove your profile so that others cannot view it, visit the Help
                section of the Websites.<br/>
                We will retain in our files information you have requested be removed from our active
                databases for certain purposes, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and
                enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior information may never be
                completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints,
                including stored &#39;back up&#39; systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your
                personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in
                response to any request you may submit.<br/>
                &nbsp;B. Control of Your Password<br/>
                You are responsible for all actions taken with your login information and password,
                including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your
                ForeverWeLove.compassword or login information to any third party. If you choose to
                share this information with any third party, you are responsible for all actions taken with
                your login information and password, and therefore should review each third party&#39;s
                privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control
                over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding
                actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised in any
                way, you should immediately change your password.

                addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that
                you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on
                other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of
                the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers,
                they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since ForeverWeLove.com does not control
                the privacy policies of any third parties, you should investigate their policies before you
                disclose your personal information to them.<br/>

                <p class="content-space">ForeverWeLove.com uses industry standard practices, including &quot;firewalls&quot; and Secure
