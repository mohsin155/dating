                <p class="content-space">Although ForeverWeLove.com offers each user the ability to "verify" their profile
                by presenting one form of a government-issued photo identification, verification
                is not required to become a member/user on the ForeverWeLove.com website.
                Additionally, ForeverWeLove.com LLC does not conduct criminal background
                checks on users of our website. Therefore, if you would like more information
                about someone before meeting them in person, there are various mechanisms
                that you can consider employing. For example, you may utilize the Internet
                and other online resources, which are publically available to everyone. These
                publically available resources may include googling the person's name into a
                search engine or social media platforms, reviewing public information made
                available by government offices, or using an online paid service to gather a full
                background report or other available information.

                <p class="heading-space">Online Dating Safety Overview</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Meeting someone for the first time in person can be exciting and even
                intimidating simultaneously. However, it is crucial that individuals who are
                establishing contact with an individual through an online platform (especially
                online dating websites) always exercise extreme caution.
                Online Dating Safety Guidelines
                While this list may not be exhaustive, we urge ForeverWeLove.com users to
                adhere to the following recommended online dating safety guidelines.
                </p>
                <p class="heading-space">Before You Go</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                One of the first guidelines is to become familiar and establish a reasonable level
                of comfort with the person you meet online, before you agree to an offline
                meeting.
                Always meet in a public and well-lit place. First time meetings should always
                be in a populated, public location—never in a private or secluded location.
                Never meet your date at their home or at a hotel.
                Once on your date/outing, stay in an open setting, around other people. It is
                best not to go back to your date's home or bring them back to yours on the first
                several dates. If your date insists that you do things that you are
                uncomfortable with, do not hesitate to immediately terminate the date (without
                hesitation) and leave at once. Additionally, if you encounter such instances in
                which you believe you are being pressured, we ask that you use the “report an
                issue” form to notify the ForeverWeLove.com support team of this issue.
                Always inform a friend or family member of your plans, to include when and
                where you are going. Before you go on the date, text, e-mail, or leave a detailed
                note informing your friend or family member of your plans; always remember to
                include the meeting location of the date (including the address). Text them the
                phone number and as much descriptive information as possible about your
                date. In fact, it is highly recommended that you take a photo of your date
                when you initially meet, then forward the photo and detailed information to a
                friend and family member.
                Ensure your mobile phone is charged fully and with you at all times.
                Have a backup plan. Always have a backup plan, in case things do not go the
                way you expect on your date. For example, tell a friend to call or text you half
                an hour into your date to check up on you.
                </p>
                <p class="heading-space">While You Are Out</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Stay Clearheaded. Keep vigilant and sober minded and do not put yourself in a
                compromising situation. When you are fully alert, you are better equipped to
                make appropriate, sound decisions. Why not go out for coffee together?
                Drive yourself to and from the first several meetings/outings.
                Be in control of your first date. Just in case things do not go well or you
                become uncomfortable at any point, you will need to have immediate access to
                your own ride—even if that means taking a taxi, UBER, Lyft, or some other
                form of public transportation.
                Keep your wallet, purse, credit cards, and all personal items with you at all
                times. Do not risk having personal belongings stolen by your date or anyone
                else.

                If it is recommended that you refrain from consuming alcohol. However,
                regardless, if you consume any beverage, keep your eyes on your drink at all
                times, to prevent tampering.
                </p>
                <p class="heading-space">Long Distance Connections/Rendezvous</p>
                <p class="content-space">Long distance meetings can potentially pose additional safety concerns. Always
                ensure careful consideration is given to ensure “safety” first.
                When you are meeting someone in a different geographic location that requires
                travel outside of your local area and you will be out of your local area
                overnight, stay in a hotel or with friends, or family. If staying at a hotel, check
                into your own room and avoid staying in the other person's home. If you cannot
                afford your own hotel, you should not travel to visit the person.
                Use a taxi, UBER, rental car, or other public transit system to get to and from
                the airport. Securing your own ride is important, even if the person you are
                meeting volunteers to pick you up from the airport. Do not get into a personal
                vehicle with a person you have never met before and who you do not
                thoroughly know and trust.
                Keep your hotel location confidential. The person you are meeting should
                respect your privacy, until you know each other well.
                Remember to keep your family and friends informed. Tell someone who you are
                meeting, where you are going, and when you will return.
                </p>
                <p class="heading-space">Online Safety Tips</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Protect your money. Ignore any requests to send money (especially overseas or
                by wire transfer) and use the “report an issue” form to notify the
                ForeverWeLove.com support team of this issue immediately—even if the person
                claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash: the sender
                has no protections against loss and it is nearly impossible to reverse the
                transaction or trace the money, once it is sent.
                Do not share financial information (such as your credit card number or any
                bank information) with people you do not thoroughly know and trust or who
                you have not met in person. We recommend you conduct all of your
                conversations and communications via the ForeverWeLove.com website so that
                your messages will be saved as proof of any impropriety from another
                </p>
                <p class="heading-space">ForeverWeLove.com user or subscriber.</p>
                <p class="content-space">
                Guard your personal and online access information (such as social security
                number, date of birth, address, usernames, passwords, etc.).
                Be extra careful when giving out personal information such as your full name,
                phone number, place of work, email and address. Be in control of your online
                dating experience at all times. Therefore, remain anonymous, until you feel

                totally comfortable in sharing specific information. We recommend that you do
                not put any personal contact information in your profile or username.
                Use vigilance when gaining access to your account from a public or shared
                computer, to prevent others from viewing or recording your password or other
                personal information. If you share your computer with others, disable the auto
                login feature to your account and clear all saved passwords and caches.
                ForeverWeLove.com will never ask you for your password through the site or
                via email, and will never send your password over e-mail. However, the
                ForeverWeLove.com support team will provide you with instructions to reset

                your password, should you need help doing so. If you receive a message or e-
                mail asking you to share your password, do not share this private information.

                Contact the ForeverWeLove.com support team and our staff will look into it for
                you.
                Be Web Wise. Be wary of communications that ask you to act immediately,
                offer something that sounds too good to be true, or ask for personal
                information. Always trust your instinct. If something seems or feels wrong, it
                probably is.
                There are certain red flags to watch for that may indicate that you are dealing
                with a scammer. Be aware of anyone who displays any of the following:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                <li> Quickly asks to talk or chat on an outside email or messaging service</li>
                <li> Refuses to meet in person or speak over the phone</li>
                <li> Claims to be from U.S. but is currently travelling, living or working abroad</li>
                <li> Asks you for money</li>
                <li> Offers you a job</li>
                <li> Vanishes mysteriously from the site, then reappears under a different name</li>
                <li> Talks about "destiny" or "fate"</li>
                <li> Claims to be recently widowed</li>
                <li> Asks for your address under the guise of sending flowers or gifts</li>
                <li> Makes an inordinate amount of grammar and/or spelling errors</li>
                <li> Sends you emails containing strange links to third-party websites</li>
                <li> Provides a link asking you to log in with your ForeverWeLove.com 
                username or password. Your ForeverWeLove.com username and
                password only works on ForeverWeLove.com and you should never click
                on a link or log in to see anything (like more photos.) If you’re unsure, it's
                best to use the “contact us” form and ask your question.</li>

                If personal details provided by another person do not seem to add up, the
                person behaves suspiciously or pressures you for personal or financial
                information, block communications with that person and report the individual
                to the ForeverWeLove.com support team immediately.

                Block and report suspicious users. If a user is interfering with your experience
                on the ForeverWeLove.com website by using inappropriate language, sending
                harassing emails, or the like, do not hesitate to report the individual.
                You also have the option to block a person you do not want to receive
                communications from; you may also report them for any appropriate
                communications.
                If you do not have a message from the user in your inbox, your other options
                are to hide your profile, change your username (if you are a paid subscriber), or
                hide your images by marking them "Private".
